Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate Computer Vision researcher currently pursuing my Master's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, focusing on the fascinating field of 3D/4D understanding & LLM. My journey in academia is driven by a deep curiosity to explore how we can better understand and represent the world around us through advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.

When I'm not buried in code or papers, you can find me hitting the pavement for my next marathon or honing my strategic skills in a game of Texas Hold'em. I recently completed the Langzhong Marathon with a personal best time of 2 hours and 19 minutes, which I'm quite proud of!

🔭 Current focus: Advancing the state-of-the-art in point cloud analysis and representation for better 3D understanding and applications; Task-Specific Agent

🏃‍♂️ Marathon Achievements: Yulin Marathon - 2 hours 26 minutes, Langzhong Marathon - 2 hours 19 minutes. Go me！

🎲 Hobbies: Marathon running, Texas Hold'em poker, Basketball, Piano and diving into the latest tech trends.

💬 Ping me about: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Open Source Contributions, and anything that piques my curiosity.

📫 How to reach me: Best through GitHub or via email at [sunyiding@stu.xjtu.edu.cn].

Let's connect and build something great together!
